# mume
Collection of powwow scripts for MUME

QUICK START GUIDE
=================

In powwow or powtty type "#load master.txt" to load in everything. However, you will need to make some changes first!

At a minimum you'll need to edit master.txt. Open it up in a text editor and read the comments in the file.

A lot of these files are my own personal preferences and way of doing things which you may not like, especially when it comes to aliases.
Most can be found in aliases.txt, though magic ones are in magic.txt.

SPECIAL FEATURES
================

So why would you want to use these scripts at all? There are a bunch of features in these scripts that work with current powwow/powtty
which I think people may find desirable, including:

 * Highlighting: A suite of highlighting tools to aid in rapid identification of things and events. Useful for dyslexics, but WIP!
  * Highlights items and mobs in the room in a different colour.
  * Highlights communications and differentiates between mobs/shopkeepers saying things and players saying/telling you things
  * Highlights for mobs/players moving in and out of your room
  * Highlights for special events like "ACK! You lost xyz" etc
  * Combat events, eg bashing on/from you and your team, and combat status on look (who is fighting who, sitting/sneaking etc etc)
 * Auto-spell: Type "as" to cast whichever spells have dropped. sx (stat) refreshes internal state.
  * Also has an "afk cast" feature to keep spells up while you get coffee (aron/ason for resting/sleeping).
 * Enhanced spell timer: My spell timer does the usual and also shows the previous time, to give an indication of how long you have left.
 * Spell translations and highlighting for up/down etc, but without overwriting the normal message in those cases.
 * Herbs.txt: Comprehensive herb identification as well as herblore mixing assistance and mixed-kit identification
 * autodoor.txt: Automated door (and chest - experimental!) opening/unlocking/closing etc using MMapper (illegal in PK)
 * autotravel.txt: Travelling convenience, from zblam-auto-reride to catching the white ship & ferry while AFK
 * Blindness indicator: Tells your group X.mob has been blinded.
 * keys.txt: Keys identification (incomplete, but now much more up-to-date than what else I've found!)
